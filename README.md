# Jo√£o Costa - Marley Spoon code sample

In response to [challenge](https://gist.github.com/lawitschka/063f2e28bd6993cac5f8b40b991ae899)

#### Requirements
- Node 12+
- Npm 6+

#### Comments
Greetings! This was done with Node/[React](https://reactjs.org/), it wouldn't make much sense to use ruby, a backend language, to consume and display API data.

React is not a language that I've used extensively or use on a daily basis, so I'm aware that this is not on an expert level.

Test suite is just a basic and partial coverage.

If you have any doubts, please contact me on joao.costaxl@gmail.com

#### Important comment
I did not saw the nested links data for Chefs, Tags and Images was available inside the recipe data until testing. :(

So this has a lot more requests than it needed!

I'll leave it this way since it represents a sample for a more complex case, and I've spent enough time on this!
